# Agency Manifesto: Website Content Monitor

This agency is designed to monitor specific parts of websites for content changes.

**Core Objective:** Detect changes in the text content identified by a specific CSS selector on a given URL.

**Workflow:**
1.  The `MonitorCEO` receives the monitoring task (URL and CSS selector).
2.  The `MonitorCEO` delegates the task to the `WebsiteMonitor` agent.
3.  The `WebsiteMonitor` agent uses its tools:
    *   `FetchContentTool`: Retrieves the HTML from the URL.
    *   `ExtractContentTool`: Extracts text content using the CSS selector.
    *   `CompareAndPersistTool`: Compares the extracted text with the previously stored version for that URL. If it's the first time or if a change is detected, it updates the stored version and flags that a change occurred.
    *   `NotificationTool`: If a change was flagged, it reports the change (currently via console print).
4.  The result (change detected, no change, or error) is reported back through the agency.

**Guiding Principles:**
*   Accuracy: Ensure content is fetched and extracted reliably.
*   Efficiency: Perform checks at the specified interval.
*   Clarity: Clearly report when changes are detected.
